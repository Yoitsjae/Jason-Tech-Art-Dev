                <h2>Early life  and Academics</h2>
                <p>From an early age, I’ve been driven by a passion for creativity and technology, and these dual interests have shaped my journey, both academically and personally. I completed my Grade 12 at Blue Eagle High School in Johannesburg, South Africa, graduating with a Bachelor Pass. While at school, I had the privilege of serving as the Head of Communication, a leadership role where I mentored and guided my peers, which was an incredibly rewarding experience. In our school, we referred to prefects as Leaders, a title that emphasized the responsibility and influence we had in shaping the school community.</p> </a>

                <h2>Extra Currucular and Tetiary </h2>
                <p>In 2018, I expanded my leadership skills by joining the SYDY Leadership Training Program, where I graduated with exceptional achievements. This experience refined my leadership capabilities and reinforced my commitment to personal development. Despite financial constraints that prevented me from attending The University of Johannesburg and The Animation School after high school, I remained resolute in pursuing my passions. I enrolled in the ALX Online Coding Boot Camp, where I’m currently honing my programming skills, nearing the completion of the course.</p><a href="resume/Trofey  Scanner 251024 5.29.26.pdf" target="_blank">

                <h2>Experience </h2>
                <p>Since May 2020, I have been freelancing as a tutor, creating customized lessons for students of varying skill levels. This experience has strengthened my communication, patience, and teaching abilities. In addition to tutoring, I gained practical skills while working as a waiter at Tre's Jolie Restaurant during the 2017 holiday season, where teamwork and multitasking were critical to success.</p>

                <p>Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, focusing on programming, software engineering, and animation. I’m excited about the future, particularly in how I can merge my love for technology and creative arts. My goal is to contribute to fields such as game development, AI-driven animation, and mobile app design, using technology to create immersive experiences that shape the future of entertainment and education.</p>

                <h2>Beyond academics</h2>
                <p>Beyond academics, I am deeply passionate about music and animation. I compose original music and explore a variety of genres, blending sounds and rhythms to express my creativity. I also love creating digital illustrations and animations, which offer another way for me to combine artistic vision with problem-solving.</p>

                <p>I found joy in storytelling through my art. Each piece I created felt like part of a larger narrative. Over time, my love for art expanded beyond drawing characters – I became fascinated by animation and the endless possibilities it offers.</p>
                <p>Today, I aim to blend technology with traditional art to create powerful stories and experiences. I want to make animation more accessible to self-taught individuals like myself, inspiring them to bring their characters and stories to life.</p>

                <h2> personal note</h2>
                <p>On a personal note, my journey has been shaped by resilience. My family and I moved to South Africa from Zimbabwe in 2015, in search of better opportunities. As refugees, my parents faced challenges finding work that matched their qualifications, but they worked tirelessly to ensure that my siblings and I could access quality education. I learned the value of independence early on, as we were homeschooled for a period before transitioning into the South African public schooling system.

                    My parents, Jairos Ncube and Joyce Ncube, have always been my greatest supporters. My father is a freelancer and pastor, while my mother works as an administrator, and despite the obstacles, they instilled in me the values of discipline, hard work, and the importance of education. Their unwavering support has been my foundation, allowing me to chase my dreams with confidence.</p>

Whether it’s through teaching, creating art, or developing technology, I hope to inspire others who, like me, want to pursue their passions and turn challenges into opportunities.</p>
